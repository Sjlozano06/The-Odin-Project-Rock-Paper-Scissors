# The-Odin-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

The objective of the program is to create a simple rock, paper, scissors game. At first the logic will be programmed to ensure that it works correctly and then we will revisit to create a interface.

Pseudocode:

    The program will ask the user to type in "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The program must repeatedly ask until the user correctly enters a valid prompt. The input from the user must be case-insensitive.

    Then the program must generate a random computer selection.

    Once the program receives a randomly generated computer selection, both selections from the user and the computer must be compared and a winnder declared.

    The game must be repeated for 5 rounds while keeping count of the score and winner must be declared at the end.
